# PlexHomepage
A Plex landing page that redirects you to your various sites/services, forked from PlexRedirect.

## Installing:
Add this to your webserver root folder. 

## Editing:
You can edit the index.html to your liking and add your server name and links. You can also change the "document.domain" and port if it doesn't get it automatically. That way it can check the server status and update the page accordingly. Replace all instances of `mydomain.tld` with your actual domain name. If you prefer to use MailGuin for the issue e-mail, setup and account and modify `send.php` with your API information.
